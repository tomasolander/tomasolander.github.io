  Hey there! My name is Tomas and <strong>I'm a computer programmer</strong>.
  Right now I particularly fancy <strong>aerial photography</strong>
  piloting quadcopters as well as going <strong>geocaching</strong> to find
  hidden tupperware out in the woods.

  I currently work at
  <a href="http://tension.se">Tension Education</a>, which includes teaching at
  <a href="https://playgroundsquad.com">PlaygroundSquad</a> and
  <a href="http://www.falufri.se">Falu Frigymnasium</a>.
  I'm all about writing code and helping others do the same.
</p>

<p>
  As a <strong>game developer</strong>, I've made a
  <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ambassador-kane-psp/">
    PlayStation Portable game</a> and mentored
  <a href="https://playgroundsquad.com/projects/?cohort=2014">
    numerous student game projects</a>.

  I've also built <strong>mobile apps</strong> for the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYYx8jcba3k">
    Nordic World Ski Championships 2015</a>
  and the Swedish
  <a href="http://pnlapp.se">Peace & Love festival</a>.

  Finally, I've also done <strong>web development</strong>, including
  <a href="https://playgroundsquad.com">entire websites from scratch</a>,
  REST backends, and microservices - usually in Python.
