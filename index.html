  You can take a closer look at <a href="/shipped">what I've done</a>
  and <a href="/skills">what skills I have</a>,
  but the short version is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    As a <strong>game developer</strong> I've worked on
    PlayStation games and mentored numerous students to bring
    plenty of game projects to fruition.
    I like my data oriented and my C++ rather C-ish.
  </li>
  <li>
    I've built <strong>mobile apps</strong> for the
    2018 Winter Olympic Test Events, the Nordic World Ski Championships 2015
    and the Swedish Peace & Love festival.
  </li>
  <li>
    I do <strong>full stack web development</strong> ranging from
    entire websites from scratch to REST backends and microservices.
    Usually in Python and Django, but whatever is best for the job.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I've previously worked at
  <a href="http://tension.se">Tension Education</a>, which included teaching at
  <a href="https://playgroundsquad.com">PlaygroundSquad</a> and
  <a href="http://www.falufri.se">Falu Frigymnasium</a>.
