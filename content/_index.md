Hey there! My name is Tomas Olander and I'm a **computer programmer**.  
I'm currently working at King, making Candy Crush Saga even sweeter.  
I love gameplay system architecture and technical performance.

You can take a closer look at [what I've done]({{< ref "shipped.md" >}})
and [what skills I have]({{< ref "skills.md" >}}), but the short version is:

- As a **game developer** I've worked on PlayStation games and mentored numerous students to bring
  plenty of game projects to fruition. I like my data oriented and my C++ rather C-ish.
- I've built **mobile apps** for the 2018 Winter Olympic Test Events, the Nordic World Ski Championships 2015
  and the Swedish Peace & Love festival.
- I do **full stack web development** ranging from entire websites from scratch to REST backends and microservices.
  Usually in Python and Django, but whatever is best for the job.

I've previously worked at [Tension Education], which included teaching at [PlaygroundSquad]
and [Falu Frigymnasium]. If you're an alumni: feel free to reach out for any reason.
